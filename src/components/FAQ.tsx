      question: "How soon can I launch?",
      answer: "In most cases, your first campaign and automation go live in 10â€“14 days. We prioritize quick wins while building your comprehensive growth infrastructure."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you support niche tools?",
      answer: "Yes! We integrate with most CRMs, schedulers, and EHRs (via API, Zapier, or direct). Our team has experience with healthcare-specific platforms and can work with your existing tech stack."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you write content in our tone of voice?",
      answer: "Absolutely. We build comprehensive tone guides using your samples and prompts. All content is human-reviewed by our expert team to ensure it matches your brand voice perfectly."
    },
    {
      question: "Is this secure and compliant?",
      answer: "Yes. We work with legal and healthcare teams to ensure all workflows follow GDPR, HIPAA, and your jurisdiction's rules. Security and compliance are built into every system we create."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I already have marketing tools?",
      answer: "Perfect! We audit your existing tools and build around what's working. Often, we can dramatically improve results by connecting and optimizing your current systems rather than replacing them."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you measure success?",
      answer: "We track real business metrics: qualified leads, conversion rates, patient/client lifetime value, and ROI. You get transparent dashboards showing exactly how your investment is performing."
